# DGSA

This package implements distance based generalized sensitivity analysis method (DGSA).
For more information about the method please read:

interactions in sensitivity analysis: Application to reservoir modeling." Mathematical
Geosciences 46.4 (2014): 493-511.

You can install the package manually or from GitHub:

## Manual installation

Clone to your own computer, open Rstudio or R and type:

```R
install.packages("package_Location", repos = NULL, type=source)
```

You also have an option to load your clone as a project in Rstudio and then proceed with
project build <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>. This is particularly useful
if you plan on adding/modifying features.

## Installing from GitHub

First you will need to make sure that you have `devtools` installed, then you can install
with the following command:

```R
devtools::install_github("ogru/DGSA")
```

After that you can proceed to load the routines in the usual way with `library(DGSA)`.
